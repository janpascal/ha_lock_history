# Home Assistant Lock History

This is a  Home Assistant custom component that keeps track of which RFID tag was used when to lock or unlock a Z-Wave lock. 
There is also a Lovelace custom UI component to show the history in the Lovelace UI.
Up to now, this component has only been tested with a Zipato Mini RFiD Keypad.
